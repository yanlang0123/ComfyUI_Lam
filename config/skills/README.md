It ships with two prompt guides under [`references/`](h3-prompt-writing/references/):

- [`base-en.txt`](h3-prompt-writing/references/base-en.txt) — base text/keyframe modes
- [`ref-en.txt`](h3-prompt-writing/references/ref-en.txt) — full-reference (Ref2VA) mode

It outputs a co-op game intro featuring two characters, player cards, and menu interaction motion. Best for game concepts, character-led menus, and social content.

  <img src="../assets/handdrawn-live-video-generator.gif" alt="handdrawn-live-video-generator" width="240">
</p>

Create surreal short videos that blend rough glowing hand-drawn animation with live-action spaces. The skill clarifies the physical contact, designs continuous morphing, an escape route, and a delayed handheld chase movement, then writes a reusable 15-second 16:9 video prompt in the user's language. After confirmation it recommends MiniMax H3 generation and checks contact realism, camera delay, rough glowing stroke texture, and non-horror tone. Best for single-scene creative clips, not polished CG, horror jump scares, plush characters, or multi-scene cuts.
